# tsr_project

Checker ownership, immutable editor/file snapshots and shared parse caches for tsr.

The Phase 5 session/configuration coordinator and checker scheduling are still
under implementation; these building blocks do not constitute a language server.

Part of [tsr](https://github.com/ferrotype/tsr), a Rust port of
the TypeScript compiler. This project is under development; the API and supported
compiler behavior are not stable. See the repository status and sprint records
for current coverage.

Requires **Rust 1.96 or newer**.
